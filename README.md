# Made with React  
This is the react repo used to build [my portfolio website](https://benjimanclarke.ie). Having this here enables me to have a copy no matter where I am developing it, especially in remote environments.  
## Things I still have to do
- [x] portfolio is a submodule. Remove submodule and commit code inside submodule 
- [ ] Embed my Youtube streams into the page
  - Maybe an iframe now that I am on Youtube????
- [ ] Add a spotify section for recently played songs
- [x] Fix landing paragraph
- [x] Change background to a picture that I took
- [ ] Update experience section to include Browserstack
