# Made with React  
This is the react repo used to build [my portfolio website](https://benjimanclarke.ie). Having this here enables me to have a copy no matter where I am developing it, especially in remote environments.  
## Things I still have to do
- Embed my twitch streams into the page
- Add a spotify section for recently played songs
- Fix landing paragraph
